SynWriteXE
========

First of all, i'm sorry for my primitive English ;)

This is fork of original SynWrite project [http://www.uvviewsoft.com/synwrite/] with one aim - to use modern technologies: latest Unicode-aware Delphi compiler (XE3), newer toolbar components (SpTBX). In the future this SynWrite branch may become a main one.

TB2K 2.2.2 - http://www.jrsoftware.org/tb2kdl.php 

SpTBX 2.4.7 - http://www.silverpointdevelopment.com/sptbxlib/downloads.htm

DkLang 4.0RC1 - http://www.dk-soft.org/download.php?lang=ru&cat_id=4

[ i'll upload fixed components for XE3 soon (after TBX -> SpTBX migration) ]
